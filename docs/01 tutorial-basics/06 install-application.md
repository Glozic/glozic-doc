# Publish Application

Glozic Development and Deployment Lifecycle

Applications in Glozic are developed within the Studio environment. This environment provides tools for both developers and business users to test and refine applications before they are ready for production. Once testing is complete, the application can be published. This makes it available for installation in tenant portals. The tenant portal then becomes the production environment where the application is used by end-users.

Visit the tenant settings from the **Settings** button of the Application Dropdown menu as shown in the below screen capture
