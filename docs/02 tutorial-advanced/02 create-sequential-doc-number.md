# Sequential Reference Number

By default, each document created in the Glozic platform is assigned a unique 128-bit UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) in RFC 4122 version 4 format. Additionally, a simplified running number is generated for each document.

While these unique identifiers are sufficient for technical identification, many businesses prefer to use custom document numbers, such as invoice numbers, purchase order numbers, or sales order numbers, to align with their specific numbering conventions.

In this tutorial, we will explore techniques to generate and assign these custom document numbers, leveraging the underlying UUID and running number systems provided by the platform.
